  Satellite Imagery Inference on
  <br>Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller
</h1>

## About The Project

The project focuses on utilizing Deep Learning to classify Satellite Imagery, aiming to showcase the feasibility of running a highly accurate yet compact model on a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. This involves exploring diverse model architectures, building State-of-the-Art models for demonstrative purposes, and investigating Transfer Learning for adapting models to various satellite types. Ultimately, a small, high-accuracy model is developed and successfully deployed on the Raspberry Pi Pico. A script running on the host system sends images to the Pico, collects results in a CSV format, and evaluates both the results and the final model. TensorFlow Lite is employed to convert and deploy the model on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Packages required for this project

Python Packages required for this project:
```
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
pyserial
seaborn
sklearn
tensorflow
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Setup a Conda Environment (this project used Miniforge)

2. Install Packages
  * ImageMagick is required to convert TIF files of the UC Merced dataset into JPG
    ```bash
    sudo apt install imagemagick  # Ubuntu
    ```

  * Install Python Packages:
    ```bash
    $ conda activate base
    (base) $ pip install pyserial numpy tensorflow matplotlib sklearn pandas seaborn
    ```

3. Setup the Pico build environment if you want to build the Pico image from source. Otherwise, the pre-built image can be copied from `artifacts/diode.uf2` to the Pico. **See instructions below.**

4. Run `scripts/init_datasets.sh` to download, split and process the datasets.

5. All the notebooks and Pico inferencing can be re-run at this point.


----


## Deploying an image to the Pico

1. Hold the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico, and connect the Pico to the computer.
2. Navigate to the Pico drive that shows up (usually named `RPI-RP2`).
3. Copy the `artifacts/diode.uf2` file to the Pico drive.
4. The Pico will unmount automatically and flash the image. Once that happens, disconnect the Pico from the computer.
5. Activate the already-setup `conda` environment: `conda activate base`
5. Run: `python3 scripts/infer-on-pico.py`
6. Connect the Pico to the computer.


## Building an image for the Pico from source

You only need to follow these steps if you want to build the UF2 image yourself. Otherwise, just copy the pre-built UF2 image to the Pico using the instructions above.

1. Setup the Pico SDK following the instructions here for your platform:
https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf

3. Run the following:

```
$ cd pico
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

4. The image is built and ready to be copied. Follow instructions above to copy the `pico/build/diode.uf2` image and run inference.
